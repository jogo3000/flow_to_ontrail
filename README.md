# flow_to_ontrail
Chrome/Firefox/Opera extension which auto fills an ontrail.net exercise report based on a Polar Flow activity report.

Would be developers:
Clone the repository. It's not in npm. Node.js is used to control dependencies, automatic testing and builds.

<p>Install dependencies<br>
<b>npm install</b></p>
<p>Test it:<br>
<b>npm test</b></p>
<p>Sources:<br>
<b>src/</b></p>
<p>Compile:<br>
<b>npm run compile</b></p>

Build will appear in build/

For Firefox packaging, use web-ext.

Note that you can't load the extension directly from src/, it needs to be compiled.
